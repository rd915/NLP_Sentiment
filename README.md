# Natural Language Processing 

This notebook uses Sentiment Analysis to perform a comparative analysis between the sentiment in the news about Bitcoin and Ethereum.  It gives each currency a compound score based on compound, positive, negative, and neutral news. 

The second part uses a tokenizer function to pull out the 10 most popular words from the content of all the articles and displays these most popular words in a wordcloud.  

The third part uses natural entity recognition to separate words out by their part of speech.
